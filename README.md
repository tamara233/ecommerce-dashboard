## Store Dashboard - E-commerce Product Management App
This is a product management dashboard built using React.js, Redux Toolkit, and TypeScript. 
For logging in as an admin user please use **'admin'** credential for both username and password. The application allows admin users to:

- View a paginated list of products generated by using mock JSON API 
- Add new products
- Edit existing products
- Delete products
- Search, sort and filter data by fields

How to Run the Project:
### - Remotely:
Please follow the URL for live deployment in Vercel: 

### -Locally:
1. Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/tamara233/ecommerce-dashboard.git
2. Navigate to the project directory: cd store-dashboard
3. Install dependencies: npm install
4. Run the project: npm start
This will start a development server and you can view the project at http://localhost:3000/.

### Assumptions and Decisions
- Protected route /dashboard for admin users only 
- Mock API for Products: The products are fetched from a fake JSON API using Axios for requests. 
- State Management: Redux Toolkit together with Thunk is used for managing state.
- Local updates: All product changes (add, edit, delete) are done locally in memory, not persisted to a backend, so they won't survive a page refresh.
- Material-UI: The UI is styled using Material-UI components for faster development and consistent UI elements.
- Form Validation: Basic validation is applied to all forms to ensure required fields are filled.
- Pagination: The product list supports pagination with 10 products per page.
- Loading state for products.
- Search bar to filter products by name.
- Sorting data by price, name and category.

### Future Improvements
- Integrate a backend for data persistence.
- Enhance form validation with more cases.
- Add user authentication and role-based access control, persist auth token.
- Make more reusable components (forms, buttons etc.)
- Enhance pagination.
- Add custom styles with SCSS/Css modules/Styled components.

It's the first version of the project and future changes and updates can be expected upon requirement. For further clarifiations please contact the owner directly at tamara.sirakanyan@gmail.com
